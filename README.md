This plugin enables a platform-independent test execution. Due to the reduced complexity and communication via REST API,
it provides an easy and reliable entry into continuous testing. It integrates 
[ECU-TEST](https://www.tracetronic.com/products/ecu-test) with Jenkins and allows report generation and its upload of 
automated test execution.<br><br>

ECU-TEST is a test automation software for the validation of embedded systems in automotive environments developed by
TraceTronic GmbH.<br/>
This software executes regression tests which are essential for validating complex technical products such as electronic
control units (ECUs).<br/>
It supports standardized access to a broad range of test tools and provides automation of distributed test
environments (SiL – MiL – HiL – vehicle).<br><br>

**TraceTronic ECU-TEST Jenkins Plugin** project is part of
the [Automotive DevOps Platform](https://www.tracetronic.com/products/automotive-devops-platform/) by TraceTronic. With
the **Automotive DevOps Platform**, we go from the big picture to the details and unite all phases of vehicle software
testing – from planning the test scopes to summarizing the test results. At the same time, continuous monitoring across
all test phases always provides an overview of all activities – even with several thousand test executions per day and
in different test environments.<br><br>

Please consider other open-source automation solutions by [TraceTronic](https://github.com/tracetronic?type=source),
especially [Jenkins Library](https://github.com/tracetronic/jenkins-library)
and [CX Templates](https://github.com/tracetronic/cx-templates).

## Features

- Provides an easy integration and control of ECU-TEST with Jenkins
- Enables the execution of ECU-TEST packages and projects with their respective configurations
- Enable the upload of generated test reports to [TEST-GUIDE](https://www.tracetronic.com/products/test-guide/) 
- Using "pipelines first" approach to improve the automated process and traceability

## Configuration

### ECU-TEST configuration

ECU-TEST installations are administrated in the global tool configuration at section "ECU-TEST". An installation entry
is specified by an arbitrary name and the path to the installation directory. The execution on a Jenkins agent requires
the adaption of the ECU-TEST installation directory on the agent configuration page.

### Pipeline job configuration

The [Pipeline Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-aggregator) allows to orchestrate automation simple. This
plugin supports the use of all provided build steps from within a Jenkins Pipeline build. The appropriate DSL syntax for
these steps and actions can be easily generated with help of
the [Pipeline Snippet Generator](https://github.com/jenkinsci/pipeline-plugin/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md#exploring-the-snippet-generator)
.

```groovy
node('windows') {
    stage('Start Tools') {
        ttStartTool toolName: 'ECU-TEST', workspaceDir: './workspace', settingsDir: './settings'
    }
    stage('Test Execution') {
        ttRunProject testCasePath: 'sample.prj', testConfig: [tbcPath: 'sample.tbc', tcfPath: 'sample.tcf', constants: [[label: 'sample', value: '123']]]
        ttRunPackage testCasePath: 'sample.pkg', testConfig: [tbcPath: '', tcfPath: '', forceConfigurationReload: true, constants: [[label: 'sample', value: '\'sampleValue\'']]]
    }
    stage('Generate Reports') {
        ttGenerateReports 'HTML'
    }
    stage('Upload Reports') {
        ttUploadReports credentialsId: 'tgAuthKey', projectId: 1, testGuideUrl: 'http://HOST:Port'
    }
    stage('Stop Tools') {
        ttStopTool 'ECU-TEST'
    }
}
```

The [TEST-GUIDE](https://www.tracetronic.com/products/test-guide/) authentication key has to be set as a Jenkins 
[credential](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/using/using-credentials/) (username and password) to be used in the *ttUploadReports* step.

## Migration

See [migration guide](docs/Migration.md) for information about how to migrate from previous plugin version 2.x to 3.x using the new pipeline syntax.

## Contribution

To report a bug or request an enhancement to this plugin please raise a
new [GitHub issue](https://github.com/jenkinsci/ecu-test-execution-plugin/issues/new/choose).

## Known Issues

When encountering problems or error messages, please check the installed plugin version at first and update to the most recent version, if any.
If the problem still exists search the following list of issues for possible solutions, otherwise you are asked to create an [issue](#contribution).

<details>
    <summary>When executing ttRunTestFolders, an error "IllegalArgumentException" with the messages that the path does not exist occurs.</summary>

> This is an issue related to the path resolution. In order to resolve paths correctly, ECU-TEST needs to be run either
> on the server, or on a machine together with the step-executing Jenkins agent. This means in particular, that, when
> using a containerized version of ECU-TEST, the executing Jenkins agent needs to be within the same container.
